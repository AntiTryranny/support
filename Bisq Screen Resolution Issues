Regardless of ANY screen resolution I choose OR maximizing/minimizing of Bisq window, I cannot read all the text.  I cannot even scroll down or pull the window up, adjust the size of the window or otherwise get it to work.

I'm using an Acer S7 laptop, native res: 1920 x 1080, Win 8.1.  

Oh no... I can't copy/paste a screenshot here.  I don't know coding to do so. 

I just want to help improve Bisq instead of throwing it aside as so many others do.  I, too, have found it frustrating... even trying to report issues/bugs is.
