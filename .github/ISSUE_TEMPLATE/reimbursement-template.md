>_The XXXXX part in the issue title are the first 5 characters of the Trade ID._

SCREENSHOT HERE

>_The screenshot from the Bisq client must have the **Trade ID**, **Deposit**, **Maker** and **Taker** TXIDs visible. Of course some trades do not have all 3 types, that is ok. Make sure all private information is covered (like bank accounts, name, etc). **Do not upload images where sensitive private data is visible!**_

Maker:  ..........
Taker: ...........
Deposit: ..........

>_A reimbursement request has to contain textual representation of **Maker**, **Taker** and **Deposit** TXIDs (copy them from the client to the issue). **All TXIDs that are visible in the screenshot must be copied to the issue in text form!**_

Other notes:

>_Issue [#197](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/197) can be used as a good example of a correct reimbursement request._
