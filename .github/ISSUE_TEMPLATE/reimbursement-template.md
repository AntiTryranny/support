The XXXXX part in the issue title are the first 5 characters of the Trade ID.

A reimbursement request has to contain a **screenshot** (details below) and textual representation of **Maker**, **Taker** and **Deposit** TXIDs (copy them from the client to the issue). **All TXIDs that are visible in the screenshot must be copied to the issue in text form!**

The screenshot from the Bisq client must have the **Trade ID**, **Deposit**, **Maker** and **Taker** TXIDs visible. Of course some trades do not have all 3 types, that is ok. Make sure all private information is covered (like bank accounts, name, etc). **Do not upload images where sensitive private data is visible!**

Issue [#197](https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues/197) can be used as a good example of a correct reimbursement request.
